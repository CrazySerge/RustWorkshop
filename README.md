# Rust Workshop

The Rust Workshop is available via the main menu in Rust. It allows you to create new skins for items in the game.

These skins can then be voted on by users for a chance to be included with the game. If the skin is made available for sale in our store the items creator get a share of the revenue.

As of time of writing this program has generated over $250,000 for our workshop contributors.

# Rust SDK

The Rust SDK on Steam is now obsolete. You should be able to convert your old items via the ingame workshop.

This has made user created content more accessible to the majority of users, as it no longer requires you to install and use Unity. It also means that you can preview your items in game.
